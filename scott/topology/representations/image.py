    """
    A wrapper object for the data housed in the image vectorization of a persistence diagram.

    Attributes
    ----------
    homology_dims : List[int], default=[0, 1]
        Dimensions of the homology groups to compute (e.g., [0, 1] for H_0 and H_1).
    bandwidth : double, default = 1.0
        Controls the Gaussian kernel for the probability distribution calculated for each point on the birth/persistence diagram.
        See gudhi documentation for more information.
    weight : function, default = lambda x: 1
        Defines the weight function used to compute the weighted sum of the probability distributions for each point on the bith/persistence diagram, i.e. the persistence surface.
        Default is a constant function. Other common choices are a linear function or a bump function, which put greater emphasis on points with longer persistence.
        See gudhi documentation for more information.
    resolution : List[int, int], default = [20,20]
        The dimensions of the persistence image in pixels.
    _pixels : Dict[int, np.array]
        A dictionary that maps each homology dimension to its persistence image in the form of a np.array.
            Each np.array has shape (resolution[0] * resolution[1], 1), and contains the values of the persistence surface at each pixel.
        Initialized to None, set using setter method.
